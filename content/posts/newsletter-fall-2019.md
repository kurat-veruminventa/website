####Main Story
Finally, we can announce and talk about one of our summer projects; the NASA Haughton-Mars Project. At Devon Island, we were testing our technology implemented in a concept spacesuit for various missions. Controlling a drone for scouting, searching, and gathering samples is some of the tasks that are intended use cases at the Moon, Mars and beyond.

In addition, we have delivered a working demo of our gloves in VR to Norconsult and supported their unique recruitment process. This year we managed to attend the 7th China Start program, which is hosted by one of the top business schools in China, CKGSB. During the program, we visited China’s most valuable companies, e.g. Alibaba and Tencent.

####NASA Haughton-Mars Project at Devon Island
We can finally publish and talk about one of our summer projects this summer. Back at the Energy:Connected conference in April this year, we met Dr. Pascal Lee, a planetary scientist at Mars Institute and SETI Institute. Immediately we found out that we shared similar visions and details were discussed, we were invited to the testing site for the Haughton-Mars Project, Devon Island.

At Devon Island, we were testing our technology implemented in a concept spacesuit for various missions. Controlling a drone for scouting, searching, and gathering samples is some of the tasks that are intended use cases at the Moon, Mars and beyond. The SETI Institute published an official news release just a couple a days ago. Since then we have received numerous requests, such as showcase our drone glove at live television (TV2, God Morgen Norge) on Monday the 4th of November at 07:40 (CET).

####China Start program by CKGSB
Since one of our founders, Magnus Arveng, attended to the first China Start program in 2016, we have talked about returning to maintaining and developing our Chinese connections. This year we managed to attend the 7th entrepreneurial program, which is hosted by one of the top business schools in China, CKGSB. During the program, we visited China’s most valuable companies, e.g. Alibaba and Tencent, we pitched for Chinese investors and learned a lot about expanding into China.

####Kjeller Innovation
We have recently become a member of the incubator at Kjeller Innovation. Kjeller Innovation is one of Norway’s most experienced incubators for heavy technology. The team has tremendous competence in business developing, finance, marketing, and communicating. We think membership in their incubator will help us reach new heighs and achieve future goals.

####Hunger Games by Norconsult
After our summer project with Norconsult, we have maintained our good relationship with the leading consulting firm. This October, Norconsult tried out a new concept of recruiting new talents; Hunger Games 2019. Hunger Games involves a two-day process of teamwork, interviews, and a final talk competition. Ntention was invited to support the whole recruitment process and showcase our VR Gloves during the final competition.

####Pitching at CreativeTech Hunt
Earlier this month we presented our company at the CreativeTech Hunt by 657 Oslo. The vision of CreativeTech Hunt is to empower CreativeTech entrepreneurs by connecting them to corporates, investors, the startup ecosystem, and the community. It was great to meet corporates from various fields of expertise with great advice and tips for the future.
