    At Devon Island, we were testing our technology implemented in a concept
    spacesuit for various missions. Controlling a drone for scouting, searching,
    and gathering samples is some of the tasks that are intended use cases at
    the Moon, Mars and beyond.

####Developing interaction systems for the Haughton-Mars Project
The NASA Haughton-Mars Project (HMP) and collaborating organizations SETI Institute, Mars Institute, NASA Ames Research Center, Collins Aerospace, and Ntention are announcing the successful field test of an “astronaut smart glove” for future human exploration of the Moon, Mars and beyond.

Inside the Concept-spacesuit built by Collins Aerospace Ntention, Co-founder Moina Tamuly testing various mission concepts through the use Ntention’s interaction system.

Back at the Energy:Connected conference in April this year, we met Dr. Pascal Lee, a planetary scientist at Mars Institute and SETI Institute. We presented our Drone Glove to Dr. Lee and talked about our visions for the future. Immediately we found out that we shared similar visions and details were discussed, we were invited to the testing site for the Haughton-Mars Project, Devon Island.

At Devon Island, we were testing our technology implemented in a concept spacesuit for various missions. Controlling a drone for scouting, searching, and gathering samples is some of the tasks that are intended use cases at the Moon, Mars and beyond.
