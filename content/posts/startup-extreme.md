####A festival packed with extreme individuals
For the third consecutive year, we attended the Startup Extreme festival, now dubbed SX. This year they had expanded greatly, and more than 600 people from the startup community, including both startups, scaleups, investors, and media visited Voss. They also coincided the timing with “Ekstremsportveko”, moving venues to be able to house all the attendees.

We had the pleasant surprise of getting to live in “Podtown”, a trailer park motel concept with spaced up interior. This was sponsored by Innovation Norway, as we were selected to pitch as one of 12 up and coming startups to be showcased. We also announced our coming name change to the world, and we are aligning our name with our vision, becoming: Ntention.

Short introductory interview by Innovation Norway was conducted the first day, and can be seen here; *[Interview](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=700160923778122&ref=watch_permalink)*.

We were invited to Sopra Steria’s Kayak Pitching contest, and Moina blew everyone out of the water and won!
