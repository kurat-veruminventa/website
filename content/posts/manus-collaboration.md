  For the last year, Ntention has focused on the development of interaction systems in virtual reality. Virtual reality is an excellent tool for setting up low-cost and specialized testing environments. Since the summer of 2019 we have maintained a close connection to Manus and Ntention has recently signed an official collaboration with the Dutch technology company.

####Benefits of a virtual testing environment
With virtual testing environments, we're able to test both interactions by true-to-life scenes and concentrated movements. For example, we can set up scenes specialized in hand gestures and by short time execute an analysis on how users interact with the environment. This gives us a tremendous advantage in researching physical human behavior and intuitive interaction systems.

####Close collaboration the last year
To generate precise analysis and provide the user with a seamless user experience, Ntention is reliant on high-quality hardware of sensor equipment for data gathering. In the summer of 2019, we met the global leader in delivering hardware for wearable sensor technology; [Manus](https://www.manus-vr.com/). Since then we have maintained a close connection and Ntention has recently signed an official collaboration with Manus. Manus has been a pioneer in the VR-scene since 2014 and the Manus Prime Series is the result of extensive and intensive research in sensor technology. This close collaboration makes manus to Ntention's primary hardware supplier.

####The only reseller in the Nordic
Our partnership with Manus makes Ntention to the only reseller of Manus equipment in the Nordics. Some of the products we offer can be discovered at our [Hardware Page](https://ntention.com/technology/hardware/). Manus produces a complete product line of gloves that can be used for motion capture, VR training, and VR gaming with and without haptic capabilities. With the series of gloves, Manus provides the most refined experience of touch available today for AR/VR. If you have any questions or inquiries regarding hardware equipment for virtual reality solutions, don't hesitate to get in touch.   

####More details about the sensor technology
To introduce our collaboration with the Dutch technology company, Ntention is hosting a webinar together with Manus at the beginning of July. The webinar will include the most recent of Ntention's technology and an introduction to top quality hardware solutions by Manus. You can now register for our upcoming webinar [here](https://ntention.com/webinar).
