####Summer internships
For the summer months we luckily got the opportunity to work at Norconsult and Nordic Semiconductor. Two huge companies in Norway with great interest in innovation and new technology. We think this would not only help us further with our technology, but boost our networking within our fields of interest aswell.

We have 3 summer internships at Norconsult, where we work with implementation of our glove technology into a VR environment. Use cases of our summer project will primarly be used for 3d modeling and construction inspections. At Nordic Semiconductor we got 2 summer internships, which gives us a huge advantage in electronic components and technology. We would like to thank both Norconsult and Nordic Semiconductor for the opportunity.

####Opening of DIGS: Meeting with the Crown Prince of Norway
DIGS was the first coworking space in Trondheim and have experienced huge expanding the latest years. The result of the huge expanding, were revealed this year. A complete new building with a great number of offices in different sizes, event venues and lounges. We attended to the grand opening in May, where we managed to meet Crown Prince Haakon of Norway. Feedback from Crown Prince Haakon on the testing and showcasing of our technology gave us a motivation boost!

Our new website gives us advantage in showcasing several use cases of our technology and convey our vision.

####Startup Extreme
For the third consecutive year, we attended the Startup Extreme festival, now dubbed SX. This year they had expanded greatly, and more than 600 people from the startup community, including both startups, scaleups, investors, and media visited Voss. They also coincided the timing with “Ekstremsportveko”, moving venues to be able to house all the attendees.

We had the pleasant surprise of getting to live in “Podtown”, a trailer park motel concept with spaced up interior. This was sponsored by Innovation Norway, as we were selected to pitch as one of 12 up and coming startups to be showcased. We also announced our coming name change to the world, and we are aligning our name with our vision, becoming: Ntention.

BONUS; We were invited to Sopra Steria’s Kayak Pitching contest, and Moina blew everyone out of the water and won!
