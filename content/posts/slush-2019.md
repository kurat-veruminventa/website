####Huge startup and entrepreneur event
A couple of days ago we participated at the annual startup conference Slush. Slush is a student-driven, non-profit movement originally founded to change attitudes toward entrepreneurship. What started as a gathering of 300 local founders in 2008, has become a community of true global magnitude. The event gathered 25 000 curious minds, including 3 500 startups and 2 000 investors, in Helsinki (Finland) this year.

Ntention has participated in the event for years, and this year was no exception. This year we brought with our new technology and stories from our participating at NASA Haughton-Mars Project. The connection to SETI Institute caught astronaut Matthias Maurer’s attention and after a quick demonstration of the glove, we received highly valuable feedback. See the video of our meeting at [Maurer’s Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Explornaut/status/1197914067748507648?s=20).

As a result after pitching and showcasing our technology to the masses, we luckily were interviewed by international media. It’s great to be around such inspiring startups and companies with high dreams and exciting visions. This gives us an urge to keep on pushing forward and moving boundaries!
