####Main Story
To kickstart the year 2019 we attended to Consumer Electronic Show (CES 2019) in Las Vegas, United States. A place where companies from around the world showcases their most innovative technologies. One of the highlights was a meeting with Ben O’Brien, CEO of StretchSense Limited, which gave us massive information about the motion capture market.

After a successfully development of our proof-of-concept, Drone Glove, it’s exciting to try implementing our technology in other applications. This february we successfully programmed our drone glove to be compatible with a robotic arm. This way you can control a robotic arm exclusively with hand gestures.

With our market research and conversations with experienced people within the field, we consider it unreasonable to rush the Drone Glove as a B2C product into market. Today we are in contact with serious partners like Norconsult AS, Oceaneering and The Mobility Centre of Trondheim University Hospital, for applications of our technology in other fields.

During the next couple of months we will continuing our market research and uses for our technology in various fields. In addition we will participate at several conferences, including Bleeding Edge by Norconsult and Energy:connected’19 by Subsea Valley.

####Consumer Electronics Show 2019 (CES)
To kickstart the year 2019 we attended to CES 2019 – The world’s largest gathering for business for consumer technologies. It’s the global stage where next-generation innovations are introduced to the marketplace. By introducing our vision and the Drone Glove to the masses in Las Vegas, we received great feedback and connections for collaboration opportunities. One of the highlights was a meeting with Ben O’Brien, CEO of StretchSense Limited, which gave us massive information about the motion capture market.

####Custom made robotic arm
The fall 2018 we ordered a custom made robotic arm from BLJ Engineering. In February we finally received the finished product and we got into programming the control of the arm. The possibilities of usage of the machine are many, but the main objectivity involves use the robotic arm for demonstration purposes of our technology. Today we successfully programmed our drone glove to be compatible with the robotic arm. This way you can control a robotic arm exclusively with hand gestures.

####Augmented reality compatibility
When we participated at CES in Las Vegas we got in touch with Epson Moverio, who develops smart glasses with a transparent display that makes it easy to view your drone’s video feed and key flight statistics, while keeping the aircraft in sight. After an interesting conversation, the team offered us a free pair of AR-glasses to develop our technology to work with the smart glasses. After a couple of weeks back home in Norway we successfully controlled a drone with the help of AR-glasses and our Drone Glove.

####Market research and road ahead
After research and development of our proof-of-concept did come to an end in late 2018, we consider it valuable to review the potential of commercialization of the Drone Glove or implementation of the technology in other applications. With our market research and conversations with experienced people within the field, we consider it unreasonable to rush the Drone Glove as a B2C product into market. Today we are in contact with serious partners like Norconsult AS, Oceaneering and The Mobility Centre of Trondheim University Hospital, for applications of our technology in other fields.

All in all, this winter has been characterized by market research and strategy management. Our attendance at CES and insight in the motion capture market, together with our visions have given us valuable motivation to break new milestones in 2019!
