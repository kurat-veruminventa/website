  description: Our Machine Learning-based Gesture Recognition enables you to use specific hand movements, like a flick of the wrist or a set of finger movements, to control an AR/VR application. This intuitive  way of interaction lets  the user “show” the software what to do, rather than using a set of button clicks, levers or sticks to control the software.
