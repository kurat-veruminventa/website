<!BIO>
“Fredrik is a cool dude. I had to push him a lot to join the team, because by the time I invited him to an interview at the age of 19 he had already had his taste of the entrepreneurial life. When Fredrik was 15, he and his team built a Mathematics teaching app called Mathema. He had dealt with the press, gathered investments from different funds and legates, and was invited to consult the Norwegian Minister of Education. In other words Fredrik was ready for new and even more exciting adventures. ” – Moina, Co-CEO & Co-Founder
