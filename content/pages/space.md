    <h2>Situational awareness</h2>
    Our technology currently consists of advanced and precise sensor technology integrated into our Smart Gloves. Combined with our intelligent software this allows operators to easily and comfortably  control  UAVs,  industrial  machines  and  interact  in  digital  environments  such  as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality.<br><br>
    UAVs  can  be  operated  efficiently  with  gestures  combined  with  a  real-time  AR  video  feed, affording  superior  control  and  situational  awareness  for  the  operator.

<h2>Extra-vehicular activity</h2>
<div class="column">
    <div class="container">
    This concept consists of a “sensor glove” combined with Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses. The concept has been field-tested as a Human-Machine Interface (HuMI) Spacesuit Glove and Augmented  Reality  Display  for  Extra-Vehicular  Activity,  in  collaboration  with  the  NASA Haughton Mars Project.  <br><br>
    The most important part is the interaction system allowing the astronaut in a pressurized EVA suit to interact with several different systems through hand gestures combined with a video feed in the helmet.

        The Haughton-Mars Project is an international multidisciplinary field research project dedicated to advancing planetary science and exploration. The HMP is centered on the scientific study of the Haughton meteorite impact crater and surrounding terrain on Devon Island, High Arctic, viewed as a planetary analog, in particular for the Moon and Mars.<br><br>
        The HMP Exploration program seeks to use the site to develop, test, and validate new exploration technologies and strategies for planning the future human and robotic exploration of the Moon and Mars.
