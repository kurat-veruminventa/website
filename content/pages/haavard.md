<!BIO>
“After having tried being a taxi driver, middle school teacher, butcher, and a truck driver I’m guessing Håvard must have thought something like; Why not become a master of quaternions and mathematical modulation of complex hand-motions? Well, so it became. Håvard is essential to our technical core. He is writing his masters on gesture recognition. Håvard is also a true adventurer having traveled around many corners of the globe and is fluent in Spanish. He discovered machine-learning while studying in Barcelona and has amongst other things built advanced algorithms for recognition of hand motions.” – Moina, Co-CEO & Co-Founder
