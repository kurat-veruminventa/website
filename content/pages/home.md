About Ntention </h6><h2>
In order to let anyone control any machine we need to make the interaction easy and intuitive.</h2>

  <div class="column">
  Interaction with machines is constantly changing. Automation is increasing, but the number of machines we interact with is also increasing. These conditions require new and easier ways of interacting with machines to allow more people to control greater number of machines with less effort and training. That’s why we are ushering in a new paradigm of control systems.
</div>
<div class="column">Ntention are building a system of interaction between the people and the machines that is user centered – not machine centered. The machine will understand the user – not the other way around. Our goal is to understand the intent of the user and translate it to machines. This is how we are moving beyond motion capture and into the world of intention capture.</div>
