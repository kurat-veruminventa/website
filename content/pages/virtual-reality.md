        Our Machine Learning-based Gesture Recognition enables you to use specific hand movements, like a flick of the wrist or a set of finger movements, to control an AR/VR application. This intuitive  way of interaction lets  the user “show” the software what to do, rather than using a set of button clicks, levers or sticks to control the software.

    <h2>Sense of touch</h2>
    Ntention assist you to choose the right hardware for your specific use. Sensor gloves enables the user to interact with the virtual environment in a natural and intuitive way. When gloves is combined with other senses, especially sight, the amount of information increases dramatically. The increase in information reduces user error, as well as the time it takes to complete a task. <br><br>

<h2>Gesture-based interaction</h2>
<div class="column">
    <div class="container">
      We combine interaction systems and tailored functionality with AI, Machine Learning & Big Data Analysis using our algorithms to understand the intent of the user, to create robust and intuitive systems. The  way  we  approach  interaction  systems  and  gesture-based  control  and  interfacing  with machines opens opportunities for usage in a wide array of applications.<br><br>
      The ability to create intuitive hand   interfaces   and   gesture-based interaction  in  the  virtual  world  opens  the  possibilities  for  visualization,  3D  modelling, navigation,  manipulation  and  intuitive  cooperation.  Our tailored interaction  systems  in  VR are ideal  for training  of  operators,  modelling  and  cooperation.
