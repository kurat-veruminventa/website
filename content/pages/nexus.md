  description: Our Machine Learning-based Gesture Recognition enables you to use specific hand movements, like a flick of the wrist or a set of finger movements, to control an AR/VR application. This intuitive  way of interaction lets  the user “show” the software what to do, rather than using a set of button clicks, levers or sticks to control the software.

        <h2>The industry needs efficient communication</h2>
        <div class="container skinnier">
        <p>
        In the construction industry too much time is wasted and too many errors are made. This has been an inevitable part of the industry because its sheer size and complexity. It is extremely difficult to provide communication and coordinate across space and time. Getting all stakeholders up to date and communicate efficiently with a common situational awareness is essential.

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
    Ntention provides the flexible Nexus platform where all relevant information can be accessed and reviewed in a realistic and immersive environment that supports comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
    In a big meeting everyone should  be able to see and understand what is being discussed at an equal level. At the office desk an architect, a project manager or a project owner should be able to access and have an immersive experience of the updated project version. At the construction site the contractor should be able to reference all layeres of the building model from any angle at any time.</p>

    Using mobile wireless VR technology Nexus lets anyone be transported into the latest version of the project and get an unparalelled understanding of distances and placing, volumetric dimensions, accessiblity, lighting and many other variables that are repeatedly misjudged and overlooked using todays solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The stakeholders can easily experience the building and simulate the daliy use in a immersive inter-actable XR environment. Design flaws can be spotted at an early stage and addressed immediately in the virtual environment. Notes, corrections, voice messages and drawings can be made from within the virtual environment and directly be uploaded to external desktop applications (ISY). </p>

        <h6>Implementation</h6>
        <h2>Integration & Access</h2>
    </div>
<div class="column3">
    <h4>IFC files to mobile VR platform</h4>
    <p>
    Nexus relies on the industry standard IFC file format, and converts in into a compressed, high quality 3D model that can run on mobile VR devices (like an Oculus Quest).</p>
</div>
<div class="column3">
    <h4>Multiplayer functionality</h4>
    <p>
    Nexus lets several users collaborate in VR at the same time from anywhere in the world. The multiplayer and desktop user integration makes Nexus the perfect platform to use for efficient meetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="column3">
    <h4>ISY Prosjekt integration</h4>
    <p>
    During model inspection in VR, users can add tasks in the ISY Prosjekt platform either directly in VR or from the desktop application. This makes for an effective and seamless workflow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row section">
<div class="column3">
    <h4>Giving access to all stakeholders</h4>
    <p>
    Letting stakeholders form different domains in the project collaborate on the model despite technical competence. Intuitive gesture interaction on portable devices makes for a low threshold access.</p>
</div>
<div class="column3">
    <h4>Desktop Application</h4>
    <p>
    The desktop applications make for seamless meeting facilitation with integrated meeting agenda, simple model navigation, and a CCTV camera setup that follows the participants in VR automatically, all accessible through an user friendly UI.</p>
</div>
<div class="column3">
    <h4>Agenda</h4>
    <p>
    The meeting agenda is built into the desktop application where all the participants get an unrivalled insight and overview of the meeting progression. The agenda can also be viewed directly in VR through an interactable tablet.</p>

<h2>Gesture-based interaction</h2>

    <p>
      Imagine jumping into a planned project and being able to access, see and experience any part of it realistically from within in real size. You can touch any component of the model to access a copy with BIM data, pick the component up and view the part from any angle. If a part is wrong or something is out of place you can make a note or send a message immediately. You can even set up a warning sign or a question mark at a point of interest. All this can be immediately exported to collaborators and external platforms.
