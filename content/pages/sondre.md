<!BIO>
“Former pig farmer, active marathon runner, and technical wizard. Sondre is unbelievable, he always gets the job done without compromise and he is very humble and loyal. Too humble we would say because we would love to see Sondre go on rants about how smart he is because it is hard to fathom without talking big. Sondre studies electronic systems design and I hope my sister marries him someday.  ” – Moina, Co-CEO & Co-Founder
