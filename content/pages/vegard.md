<!BIO>
“We did not find Vegard, he found us. I think that categorizes him in a good way. Vegard is extremely focused and knows what he wants. I can without a doubt say that no one has entered the team already knowing what they should do to produce value and then some before.  He is an invaluable resource and his skillset ranges from design to economics and even civil engineering. Already having delivered lots of value I’m sure we have not even seen the tip of the iceberg of Vegard’s unlimited potential. 

Fun facts: Vegard won the best finance blog of the year. He is self-taught in design and is doing a double degree at NTNU. And before I forget to mention he is a sergeant and a squad leader for a Bazooka team in the Norwegian National Home Guard.  ” – Moina, Co-CEO & Co-Founder
