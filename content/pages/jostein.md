<!BIO>
“Was the angel child in school. His tests were used as a solutions manual and the teachers loved him. By high school graduation, he came out of his shell though. By the end of “Russetiden” (The Norwegian graduation celebration lasting for a month straight before finals), he had internal bleeding, a broken hip-bone and two lawsuits for obstruction of property against him. Anyhow, we’re glad his brain stayed intact. He then served in the Norwegian Army. Jostein was a straight-A student at cybernetics and robotics until he started working with us in the fall of 2019 fully dedicating himself to the company. He is also a certified parachute jumper.  ” – Moina, Co-CEO & Co-Founder
